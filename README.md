## Why Boxer?

Boxer is a pet content aggregator that takes a customer's previous search history on the boxer site as well as details about
their pet and creates mystery boxes of different values. These boxes will contain 4 unique pet-centric producuts tailored 
for the customer and their price point. A customer may also choose their own items; however, if the user navigates from the page, it's possible that
they will not see the product again.
